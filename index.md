## About me

Hi! My name is Harsh Gurnani, and I am a second year computer science major at UCSD. I am a software developer greatly interested in machine learning and its application. In particular, I am excited by healthcare technology, a field with the potential for much innovation and real-world impact. To this end, my most used line of code is likely:

```
import pandas as pd
```

Outside of programming and school, I **_love_** to travel. My favorite destination so far has been Rome - I really enjoy learning about the history of places, and Rome has a lot to offer in that sense (and the food was great).

> The best part of Rome was the gelato - this store had 150 different flavors!

Some of my other top recommendations, in order, are:

1. Barcelona, Spain
2. San Diego, CA, USA
3. Dubai, UAE
